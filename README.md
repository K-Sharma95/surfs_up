#Overview of the analysis
This is an analysis designed for the purposes of opening an ice cream shop in O'ahu, Hawaii. This analysis will use weather/climate data, namely temperature and percipitation in order to determine the potential success of an ice cream shop on the beach. This analysis will help inform business decision making, and answer the question; Is this ice cream shop feasable all year round?

#Results
In order to determine if this ice cream shop is attainable all year round, I analyzed weather data from June and December. Some differences found in these months are;
1. Lower mean temperature
December has a mean temp of 71 degrees, while June has a mean temp of 75 degrees. These are quite similar, however a lower mean in December may indicate times when Ice Cream may not be a suitable food as it is too cold. However this result is expected.
2. Drastically lower min temperature
