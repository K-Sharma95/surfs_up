# Overview of the analysis
This is an analysis designed for the purposes of opening an ice cream shop in O'ahu, Hawaii. This analysis will use weather/climate data, namely temperature and percipitation in order to determine the potential success of an ice cream shop on the beach. This analysis will help inform business decision making, and answer the question; Is this ice cream shop feasable all year round?

## Results
In order to determine if this ice cream shop is attainable all year round, I analyzed weather data from June and December. Some differences found in these months are;

1. Lower mean temperature
December has a mean temp of 71 degrees, while June has a mean temp of 75 degrees. These are quite similar, however a lower mean in December may indicate times when Ice Cream may not be a suitable food as it is too cold. However this result is expected.

2. Drastically lower min temperature 
In December we have observed a min temp of 54 in precious years, and in June we have observed a min temp of 64. In my opinion, 54 is near the temperature that the average customer will not be interested in a cold treat, but rather a warm one. For this reason I think the Ice Cream shop will expereince less demand for its products in December, and should consider this when determining if this business will be profitable. 

3. Similar max temperatures
Due to the tripical climate in Hawaii, the max temps in both of these months are high, near 85 degrees in both cases. This is good news for the owner of an ice cream shop as some days of the month will be much warmer than others, and demand will increase. 


## Summary

In conclusion, I believe this analysis has provided accurate temperature and percipitation data for any business owner to analyze and determine if they will be profitable. Some additional queries I would perform for June and December would be percipitation analysis. I would expect December to have higher percititation.
